Physical-Computing-Final
========================

A device to help you understand the area you enter. For my Physical Computing final I am going to create a device that lets you understand a particular environment or district you walk into. Pretend like you're walking and you quickly want to know what there is to do in say Saint Marks - this will help you.

A very simple application using Arduino for the client, and Node.JS/Bootstrap/Socketio for the user.
